# Refactor JavaScript to TypeScript

## Introduction/Overview

Convert existing JavaScript files to TypeScript, ensuring full type safety across the application. This refactoring will improve code maintainability, catch potential bugs at compile time, and provide better developer experience through enhanced IDE support.

## Goals

- Convert all JavaScript files to TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Ensure the application compiles without type errors
- Maintain existing functionality while adding type safety
- Improve code maintainability and readability
- Set up proper TypeScript configuration and tooling

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to have type safety so that I can catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
- As a developer, I want better IDE support so that I can have autocomplete and refactoring capabilities
- As a maintainer, I want well-typed code so that I can understand the data flow and make changes with confidence

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must convert all `.js` files to `.ts` or `.tsx` files
2. The system must add appropriate type definitions for all functions, variables, and parameters
3. The system must configure TypeScript compilation settings
4. The system must ensure all imports and exports are properly typed
5. The system must maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
6. The system must add type definitions for external dependencies where needed

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Rewriting existing logic or algorithms
- Changing the application's architecture
- Adding new features during the refactoring process
- Converting test files (unless they are critical for the build process)

## Design Considerations

- Use strict TypeScript configuration for maximum type safety
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Maintain the same file structure and organization
- Consider using utility types and interfaces for complex data structures

## Technical Considerations

- Ensure compatibility with existing build tools and bundlers
- Update package.json scripts to include TypeScript compilation
- Consider using `@types` packages for external dependencies
- May need to update ESLint configuration for TypeScript

## Success Metrics

- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- All existing functionality continues to work as expected
- Improved developer experience with better IDE support
- Reduced runtime errors due to type safety

## Open Questions

- Should we use strict TypeScript configuration from the start?
- Are there any external dependencies that need type definitions?
- Should we convert test files as well?
- What TypeScript version should we target?

## Status

- **Current Status**: Todo
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Medium
- **Dependencies**: None
