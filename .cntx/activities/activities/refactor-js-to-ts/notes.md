# Notes: Refactor JavaScript to TypeScript

## General Notes

This file captures additional thoughts, decisions, and insights during the TypeScript refactoring process.

## Technical Decisions

### TypeScript Configuration

- **Decision**: Use strict TypeScript configuration
- **Rationale**: Maximum type safety and catching potential issues early
- **Impact**: May require more initial work but provides better long-term benefits

### File Naming Convention

- **Decision**: Use `.ts` for regular TypeScript files, `.tsx` for React components
- **Rationale**: Standard convention that clearly indicates file type
- **Impact**: Clear distinction between regular TypeScript and React TypeScript files

### Type Definitions

- **Decision**: Create interfaces for complex data structures
- **Rationale**: Better code documentation and IDE support
- **Impact**: More verbose but more maintainable code

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: External Dependencies

- **Issue**: Some dependencies may not have TypeScript definitions
- **Solution**: Use `@types` packages or create custom type definitions
- **Status**: To be addressed during implementation

### Challenge: Dynamic Imports

- **Issue**: Some files use dynamic imports that may be harder to type
- **Solution**: Use `any` type initially, then refine as needed
- **Status**: To be addressed during implementation

## Lessons Learned

_To be filled during implementation_

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding TypeScript-specific linting rules
- Plan for gradual migration of test files
- Consider using TypeScript for new features going forward
