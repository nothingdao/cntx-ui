# API Audit, Refinement, and Documentation

## Introduction/Overview

Review all existing API endpoints, refine their design for consistency and efficiency, and generate comprehensive documentation. This activity will ensure the API is well-designed, properly documented, and follows best practices for maintainability and developer experience.

## Goals

- Audit all existing API endpoints for consistency and best practices
- Refine API design for improved efficiency and usability
- Generate comprehensive, up-to-date API documentation
- Ensure API follows RESTful principles and conventions
- Improve error handling and response formats
- Make API documentation easily accessible to developers

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want clear API documentation so that I can understand how to use the endpoints
- As a developer, I want consistent API responses so that I can build reliable integrations
- As a maintainer, I want well-designed APIs so that I can easily extend and modify them
- As a user, I want reliable error messages so that I can understand and fix issues

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must audit all existing API endpoints for design consistency
2. The system must identify and fix inconsistencies in response formats
3. The system must standardize error handling across all endpoints
4. The system must generate comprehensive API documentation
5. The system must ensure all endpoints follow RESTful conventions
6. The system must validate request/response schemas
7. The system must create examples for all API endpoints
8. The system must document authentication and authorization requirements

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Rewriting the entire API from scratch
- Changing the core business logic of endpoints
- Adding new features or endpoints
- Changing the database schema or data models

## Design Considerations

- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Use consistent HTTP status codes
- Implement proper error handling with meaningful messages
- Consider API versioning strategy
- Ensure backward compatibility where possible

## Technical Considerations

- Use OpenAPI/Swagger specification for documentation
- Consider rate limiting and security measures
- Implement proper logging for API requests
- Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed endpoints
- Ensure proper CORS configuration

## Success Metrics

- All API endpoints have consistent response formats
- Comprehensive documentation is generated and accessible
- Zero breaking changes to existing integrations
- Improved API response times and reliability
- Reduced support requests related to API usage

## Open Questions

- Should we implement API versioning?
- What authentication method should we use?
- Should we implement rate limiting?
- What format should the documentation be in (OpenAPI, Markdown, etc.)?
- Should we add API testing endpoints?

## Status

- **Current Status**: Todo
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Estimated Effort**: Large
- **Dependencies**: None
