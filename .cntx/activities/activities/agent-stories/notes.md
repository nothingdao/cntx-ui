# Notes: Agent Stories Research and Optimization

## General Notes

This file captures additional thoughts, decisions, and insights during the Agent Stories research process.

## Research Approach

### Cave Exploration Metaphor

- **Concept**: Agents explore codebases incrementally like cave exploration
- **Key Principles**:
  - Start with high-level overview, then dive deeper based on user needs
  - Use context efficiently to minimize token usage
  - Allow agents to make exploration choices based on user input
  - Progressive context discovery rather than loading everything at once

### Agent Interaction Patterns

- **Entry Points**: Multiple ways for agents to start exploring (bundles, activities, direct file access)
- **Navigation**: Clear paths for agents to follow based on their current task
- **Context Management**: Efficient strategies for maintaining and updating context

## Technical Decisions

### MCP Server Integration

- **Decision**: Focus on testing existing MCP server tools with Claude agents
- **Rationale**: Understand current capabilities before extending
- **Impact**: Will inform future tool development and optimization

### Vector Database Usage

- **Decision**: Leverage existing vector database for semantic search
- **Rationale**: Provides efficient context discovery without loading entire codebase
- **Impact**: Enables progressive context loading and token efficiency

### Activity Management Integration

- **Decision**: Design patterns for agents to contribute to activity management
- **Rationale**: Agents should be able to help with project organization
- **Impact**: Creates symbiotic relationship between agents and project structure

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Token Efficiency Measurement

- **Issue**: Need to measure and validate token usage improvements
- **Solution**: Create benchmarking framework for different interaction patterns
- **Status**: To be addressed during research

### Challenge: Agent Story Standardization

- **Issue**: Need consistent format for documenting agent interaction scenarios
- **Solution**: Create comprehensive templates and examples
- **Status**: To be addressed during documentation phase

### Challenge: Progressive Context Discovery

- **Issue**: Balancing comprehensive coverage with efficient context loading
- **Solution**: Design dependency mapping and prioritization strategies
- **Status**: To be addressed during strategy development

## Key Research Questions

1. **What are the optimal entry points for different types of agent tasks?**
2. **How can we measure and validate token efficiency improvements?**
3. **What patterns work best for progressive context discovery?**
4. **How should agents contribute to project organization and documentation?**
5. **What are the most valuable MCP server tools for agent interactions?**

## Lessons Learned

_To be filled during research_

## Future Considerations

- Consider expanding research to other AI agents beyond Claude
- Plan for integration with other development tools and workflows
- Consider creating agent-specific optimization strategies
- Plan for continuous improvement based on usage patterns
