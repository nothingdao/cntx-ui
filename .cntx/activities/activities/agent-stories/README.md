# Agent Stories: Research and Optimization

## Introduction/Overview

Create a comprehensive research activity to systematically test and discover optimal patterns for agent interactions with cntx-ui through the `.cntx` directory and MCP server. This research will focus on enabling agents to navigate projects incrementally (like a cave exploration game) while maintaining context efficiency for Node.js/React developers. The goal is to achieve 120% coverage of all possible agent interaction scenarios and create an actionable plan for continuous agent testing.

## Goals

- Discover optimal agent entry points and navigation patterns through the `.cntx` directory
- Test and validate MCP server tools and vector database integration
- Create comprehensive "agent stories" (test scenarios) covering all interaction patterns
- Develop progressive context-gaining strategies that minimize token usage
- Establish evolving standards for rules, tools, prompts, and tone
- Design patterns for agents to contribute to the `.cntx` directory as projects evolve
- Create an actionable plan for the "Agent Stories Cycle" - an ongoing testing activity

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want agents to explore my codebase incrementally so that I can maintain context efficiency and minimize token costs
- As a developer, I want agents to have access to comprehensive tools through the MCP server so that they can provide intelligent assistance
- As a developer, I want agents to contribute to project organization so that my `.cntx` directory evolves with my project needs
- As an agent, I want clear navigation patterns and progressive context access so that I can explore codebases efficiently
- As an agent, I want well-defined tools and instructions so that I can provide consistent, helpful assistance

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must analyze current agent interaction patterns in the `.cntx` directory
2. The system must test MCP server tools and vector database integration with Claude agents
3. The system must create comprehensive "agent stories" covering all interaction scenarios
4. The system must develop progressive context-gaining strategies
5. The system must establish standards for agent instructions, tools, and communication
6. The system must design patterns for agent contributions to project organization
7. The system must create an actionable plan for continuous agent testing
8. The system must validate efficiency improvements for token usage

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Testing agents outside of the cntx-ui codebase
- Implementing production-ready agent tools (this is research phase)
- Creating agent-specific implementations (focus on patterns and standards)
- Optimizing for agents other than Claude (though patterns should be generalizable)

## Design Considerations

- Focus on Claude agents using Claude Code CLI and Claude Desktop with MCP integrations
- Consider the distinction between `.cntx` directory tools and MCP server capabilities
- Design for progressive evolution of project context and organization
- Ensure patterns work for Node.js/React development workflows
- Consider the "cave exploration" metaphor for incremental context discovery

## Technical Considerations

- Leverage existing vector database and semantic search capabilities
- Test MCP server tools and their integration with agent workflows
- Analyze current `agent-instructions.md` and related documentation
- Consider the relationship between bundle management and agent navigation
- Explore how agents can contribute to activity management and project organization

## Success Metrics

- Comprehensive coverage of agent interaction scenarios (120% target)
- Documented best practices for agent navigation and context management
- Measurable improvements in token efficiency for agent interactions
- Actionable plan for "Agent Stories Cycle" continuous testing
- Validated patterns for agent contributions to project organization
- Clear standards for agent instructions, tools, and communication

## Open Questions

- What specific MCP server tools are most valuable for agent interactions?
- How can we measure and validate token efficiency improvements?
- What patterns work best for progressive context discovery?
- How should agents contribute to activity management and project organization?
- What are the optimal instruction formats for different agent interaction types?
- How can we balance comprehensive coverage with practical implementation?

## Status

- **Current Status**: Todo
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Large
- **Dependencies**: None
