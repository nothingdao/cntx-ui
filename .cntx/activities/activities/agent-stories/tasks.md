## Relevant Files

- `.cntx/agent-instructions.md` - Current agent instructions to analyze
- `User Stories for Agents in a Codebase (Simplified).md` - Agent user stories documentation
- `Agent Specification for Codebase Exploration and Development (Simplified).md` - Agent specifications
- `lib/mcp-server.js` - MCP server implementation to test
- `lib/agent-tools.js` - Agent tools implementation to analyze
- `lib/simple-vector-store.js` - Vector database implementation
- `lib/semantic-splitter.js` - Semantic analysis tools
- `lib/function-level-chunker.js` - Code chunking functionality
- `lib/treesitter-semantic-chunker.js` - AST-based chunking
- `.cntx/activities/` - Activity management system to integrate with
- `docs/agent-stories/` - Documentation directory (to be created)
- `tests/agent-interactions/` - Test scenarios directory (to be created)
- `scripts/agent-testing/` - Testing scripts directory (to be created)

### Notes

- Focus on Claude agent interactions specifically
- Consider both `.cntx` directory and MCP server capabilities
- Test scenarios should be documented as "agent stories"
- Consider token efficiency measurements throughout
- Use the "cave exploration" metaphor for incremental context discovery
