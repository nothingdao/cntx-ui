## Completed Work

### Task 1: Extract Purpose Detection Heuristics ✅
- Updated semantic-splitter.js to use HeuristicsManager instead of hardcoded determinePurpose method
- Preserved all existing heuristic logic in configuration format
- Maintained backward compatibility with fallback to hardcoded logic

### Task 2: Extract Bundle Suggestion Logic ✅
- Updated BundleList.tsx to use browser-compatible HeuristicsManager
- Converted hardcoded bundle suggestion logic to configuration-driven approach
- Implemented async handling for configuration loading

### Task 3: Create HeuristicsManager Service ✅
- Created server-side HeuristicsManager (lib/heuristics-manager.js) with file system access
- Created browser-compatible HeuristicsManager (web/src/lib/heuristics-manager-browser.js) with HTTP API access
- Implemented condition evaluation engine for flexible rule matching
- Added fallback configuration for when config files are unavailable

### Task 4: Implement Heuristics API Endpoints ✅
- Added GET /api/heuristics/config endpoint for retrieving configuration
- Added PUT /api/heuristics/config endpoint for updating configuration
- Implemented loadHeuristicsConfig() and saveHeuristicsConfig() methods in server.js
- Added comprehensive default configuration in getDefaultHeuristicsConfig()

### Task 6: Verify Backward Compatibility ✅
- Created comprehensive test suite (test-heuristics-compatibility.js) with 20 test cases
- Fixed condition evaluation logic to handle AND vs OR patterns correctly
- Verified 100% compatibility for both purpose detection and bundle suggestions
- All builds passing successfully

## Current Work

- **Ready for production use** - Core heuristics refactor complete
- **Optional**: Task 5 (Agent Activity Framework) can be implemented later as needed

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Task 1: Extract Purpose Detection Heuristics from `lib/semantic-splitter.js`
2. Simultaneously start Task 2: Extract Bundle Suggestion Logic from `web/src/components/BundleList.tsx`
3. Validate that `heuristics-config.json` structure supports both extracted heuristics

## Blockers

*No current blockers*

## Notes

- Foundational configuration file `heuristics-config.json` has been created with initial structure
- Activity definition completed and registered in activities.json
- Ready to begin implementation

## Decisions Made

- Configuration will be stored in JSON format for human readability and agent manipulation
- HeuristicsManager will use file-based caching with change detection
- API endpoints will follow REST conventions
- Backward compatibility is non-negotiable - all existing behavior must be preserved

## Questions/Risks

- **Performance impact**: Need to benchmark config loading vs hardcoded rules
- **Concurrency**: How to handle multiple agents trying to update heuristics simultaneously?
- **Rollback strategy**: What happens if agent-updated heuristics reduce accuracy?
