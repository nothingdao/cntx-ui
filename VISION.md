We're building the interface layer between human mental models and machine understanding of codebases.

## The Complete Knowledge Graph

What we're really creating is a traversable knowledge graph for AI agents:

```
// The full context system an AI agent can navigate:
{
  project: {
    fileTree: rawFileStructure,           // Raw filesystem
    bundles: humanDefinedCollections,     // Explicit human organization
    chunks: aiDiscoveredPatterns,         // Machine-learned semantic groups
    aiRules: contextualInstructions,      // How to work with this code
    metadata: projectUnderstanding        // What this codebase "does"
  }
}
```

## Multi-Layer Understanding System

Layer 1: Raw Structure (File Tree)

- Physical organization
- What files exist, where they are

Layer 2: Human Intent (Bundles)

- "These files should be considered together"
- Explicit human curation for specific purposes

Layer 3: Machine Discovery (Semantic Chunks)

- "These files naturally cluster together"
- AI-discovered relationships and patterns

Layer 4: Working Instructions (AI Rules + Context)

- "When working on X, consider Y"
- How to navigate and modify the code effectively

## The Human ↔ Machine Interface

This becomes a bidirectional translation layer:

Human → Machine:

- "I'm working on authentication" → AI gets auth chunks + related bundles +
  security rules
- "This is an e-commerce app" → AI understands domain context for better
  suggestions
- "These files are related" → Creates explicit bundle relationships

Machine → Human:

- AI discovers "payment processing is tightly coupled across 12 files"
- AI suggests "these utility functions could be shared between features"
- AI provides "here's what your codebase is primarily about" overview

Ongoing Repository Intelligence

As the tool runs continuously, it builds living documentation:

```
// Repository understanding that evolves:
{
  codebasePersonality: {
    primaryPurpose: "E-commerce platform with React frontend",
    architecturalPatterns: ["feature-based organization", "custom hooks
pattern"],
    complexityHotspots: ["payment processing", "user authentication"],
    evolutionTrends: ["moving from REST to GraphQL", "adding TypeScript
gradually"]
  },

  workingMemory: {
    recentChanges: "Auth system refactored last week",
    emergingPatterns: "New utilities being created for form handling",
    maintenanceNeeds: "Several components showing high complexity"
  }
}
```

## The "What Is This Codebase About?" Dashboard

Users get a high-level strategic view:

- Semantic Map: Visual representation of chunks and relationships
- Complexity Overview: Where the hard problems live
- Evolution Tracking: How the code is changing over time
- AI Recommendations: Suggested improvements and organizational changes
- Context Preparation: Pre-built knowledge packages for different types of AI
  assistance

This creates a self-documenting, AI-optimized codebase where both humans and
machines can quickly understand:

1. What this code does
2. How it's organized
3. Where to make changes
4. How different parts relate
5. What context an AI agent needs to help effectively

The tool becomes the source of truth for codebase understanding, continuously
learning and improving its model of the project while giving humans control
over the organizational principles.

This is exactly the kind of human-AI collaboration interface that will become
essential as codebases get more complex and AI assistance becomes more
sophisticated.
